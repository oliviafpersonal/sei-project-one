Frogger 

This game was my first attempt to use all the vanilla JavaScript skills I had learnt so far, 4 weeks into the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course. 

Task: To build a grid-based browser game with pure Javascript in a 7 week timeline. 

Technologies Used:
- JavaScript ES6
- HTML5
- CSS
- GitHub 

Overview:

My Frogger game was designed with a makeup theme. 
I chose to do this as it incorporated a part of my personality whilst still sticking to the original and classic functionality of the game. 
The user is in control of a lipstick which can be moved using the up, down, right and left arrows. 
The user must navigate the grid, avoiding the lids which move across the screen, hop onto the moving hands in order to avoid falling into the water with the aim of eventually landing on the home of lips. 
The player has 3 lives to achieve the goal of landing on one of the three lips available.

Once the player runs out of lives, a browser pop up informs the player that they have lost, with a message including their final score. This score then is set as the high score, and the lives are reset. If the player successfully reaches the lips, the level is increased, and so is the speed of the obstacles the player needs to avoid.
